## Dependencies & Blockers

### External Dependencies
- **Marvel Rivals API**: Must remain stable and accessible
- **API Rate Limits**: 10,000 requests/day (free tier)
- **Game Patches**: May invalidate data, require re-collection
- **Odin Server**: Must remain operational for hosting
- **Caddy Reverse Proxy**: Integration with existing server-stack

### Technical Dependencies
```
Phase 1 (MVP - CLI)
â””â”€â”€ Phase 2 (Polish + Web API) [requires Phase 1 data + PostgreSQL setup]
    â””â”€â”€ Phase 3 (Frontend + Synergies) [requires Phase 2 API + Docker deployment]
        â””â”€â”€ Phase 4 (Advanced + Infrastructure) [requires Phase 3 web presence]
            â””â”€â”€ Phase 5 (Community + Scale-out) [requires Phase 4 stability]
```

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- **Phase 1**: Local development only
- **Phase 2**: PostgreSQL on Odin, Docker setup, Caddy configuration
- **Phase 3**: Next.js deployment, multi-container orchestration
- **Phase 4**: Redis, monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana)
- **Phase 5**: Consider hosted services if traffic exceeds server capacity

---

## Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks

**Risk**: API rate limits prevent data collection
**Mitigation**: Implement aggressive caching, request throttling, batch processing

**Risk**: Insufficient sample sizes for rare heroes
**Mitigation**: Document sample sizes, filter results, consider longer collection period

**Risk**: Player rank data is stale or missing
**Mitigation**: Validate rank data quality, document limitations, filter WHERE NOT NULL

**Risk**: Odin server outage or resource constraints
**Mitigation**: Monitor resource usage, database backups to NFS, document migration path to hosted services

### Medium-Priority Risks

**Risk**: Statistical calculations are incorrect
**Mitigation**: Use well-tested scipy library, add comprehensive unit tests, peer review

**Risk**: Community misinterprets results
**Mitigation**: Include confidence intervals, document methodology, add disclaimers

**Risk**: Web traffic exceeds server capacity
**Mitigation**: Implement caching (Redis), CDN for static assets, consider migration to hosted services if needed
