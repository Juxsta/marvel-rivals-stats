# Marvel Rivals Stats Analyzer - Mission

## Vision

A data-driven tool for Marvel Rivals players to understand character performance, identify winning team compositions, and make informed strategic decisions based on statistical analysis of real match data.

## Mission Statement

Provide the Marvel Rivals community with accurate, statistically significant insights into:
- Character win rates across all skill levels
- Team composition synergies and counter-strategies
- Meta trends and optimal hero pairings
- Data-driven recommendations for team building

## Target Users

### Primary Audience
- **Competitive Players**: Looking to optimize team compositions and hero selections
- **Content Creators**: Need data for tier lists, guides, and meta analysis
- **Team Coaches**: Want evidence-based strategies for organized play

### Secondary Audience
- **Casual Players**: Interested in understanding which heroes perform well
- **Game Analysts**: Studying game balance and meta evolution
- **Community Leaders**: Sharing insights with their communities

## Problems We Solve

### 1. Lack of Data-Driven Meta Understanding
**Problem**: Players rely on anecdotal evidence and streamer opinions without statistical backing.

**Solution**: Provide win rates with confidence intervals based on thousands of real matches, stratified by rank tier.

### 2. Team Composition Guesswork
**Problem**: Players don't know which heroes synergize well together beyond basic role composition.

**Solution**: Analyze pair-wise synergies showing which heroes win significantly more when played together.

### 3. Rank-Specific Performance Unknown
**Problem**: What works in Bronze may not work in Grandmaster, but players lack rank-specific data.

**Solution**: Stratify all statistics by rank tier, providing relevant insights for each skill level.

### 4. Inaccessible Analysis Tools
**Problem**: Existing analytics require APIs, web scraping skills, or proprietary access.

**Solution**: Open-source CLI tool with exportable JSON data for community use.

## Core Value Propositions

1. **Statistical Rigor**: Minimum sample sizes, confidence intervals, significance testing
2. **Rank-Stratified Analysis**: Separate insights for different skill levels (Bronze → Celestial)
3. **Actionable Insights**: Not just "what wins" but "what wins together"
4. **Community-Driven**: Built on real player data, not just theory
5. **Transparency**: Open methodology, reproducible results, open source

## Product Principles

### 1. Data Quality First
- Never present data without sufficient sample size
- Always show confidence intervals
- Filter for current season/patch only
- Deduplicate matches to avoid bias

### 2. Accessibility
- Clear, non-technical explanations
- Export formats for third-party tools
- Open source for community integrations
- Simple CLI interface

### 3. Transparency
- Document sampling methodology
- Explain statistical calculations
- Open source code and schema
- Reproducible analysis

### 4. Respect for Players
- No player shaming or ranking
- Privacy-conscious data collection
- Rate limit compliance with API
- Community feedback integration

### 5. Scientific Rigor
- Stratified random sampling
- Bias mitigation strategies
- Peer-reviewable methodology
- Conservative confidence thresholds

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Sample Size**: 50,000+ matches collected
- **Coverage**: All 40+ heroes analyzed
- **Accuracy**: Win rates ±5% of community consensus
- **Freshness**: Data updated weekly

### Community Metrics
- **Adoption**: Used by 10+ content creators
- **Citations**: Referenced in tier lists/guides
- **Feedback**: Positive community reception
- **Impact**: Influences team composition discussions

### Quality Metrics
- **Statistical Significance**: 95% confidence on all reported stats
- **Representativeness**: Sample distribution matches ranked population
- **Reliability**: Consistent results across re-sampling
- **Validity**: Correlates with tournament/high-level play

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- ❌ Player ranking or leaderboards (use official tools)
- ❌ Live match tracking (use Overwolf/trackers)
- ❌ Build recommendations (gear/loadouts)
- ❌ Real-time meta dashboard (focus on periodic analysis)
- ❌ Social features (comments, forums, profiles)
- ❌ Monetization (free community tool, self-hosted)

## Strategic Differentiators

### vs. Community Tier Lists
- **Data-driven** rather than opinion-based
- **Quantified confidence** intervals instead of subjective rankings
- **Rank-specific** insights instead of one-size-fits-all

### vs. Official Stats
- **Synergy analysis** beyond individual hero stats
- **Stratified sampling** for representative results
- **Open methodology** for community validation

### vs. Tracker Sites
- **Aggregate analysis** not individual tracking
- **Statistical rigor** with significance testing
- **Export capability** for integration

## Long-Term Vision

### Phase 1 (Q1 2025): Foundation
Establish data collection pipeline and prove statistical methodology with character win rate analysis.

### Phase 2 (Q1-Q2 2025): Web Platform
Deploy FastAPI backend and PostgreSQL database on self-hosted infrastructure (Odin server), making data accessible via web API.

### Phase 3 (Q2 2025): Public Interface & Synergies
Launch Next.js web interface at `rivals.jinocenc.io` with interactive visualizations. Expand analysis to team composition and hero synergies.

### Phase 4 (Q3 2025): Advanced Analytics
Track meta evolution over time, counter-pick recommendations, full team composition templates, and production-grade infrastructure.

### Phase 5 (Q3-Q4 2025): Community & Scale
Public API for integrations, Discord bot, community contributions. Plan migration to hosted services if traffic exceeds server capacity.

## Target Impact

**For Competitive Players**: Make data-informed hero selections that improve win rates by leveraging statistical insights.

**For Content Creators**: Produce evidence-based guides and tier lists backed by thousands of matches, not anecdotes.

**For the Community**: Elevate the strategic discourse around Marvel Rivals with rigorous, transparent, accessible data analysis.
