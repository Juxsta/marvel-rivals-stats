## Structural Verification (Checks 1-2)

### Check 1: Requirements Accuracy
**Status**: PASS

All user answers from Q&A session accurately captured in requirements.md:

1. **Q1 - Phase 1 Priority**: Requirements correctly prioritize Phase 1 (methodology fix) over maximum statistical power
2. **Q2 - Data Collection**: Requirements correctly specify manual periodic runs (no automation in scope)
3. **Q3 - Baseline Model**: Requirements correctly specify average model as primary, with additive as optional
4. **Q4 - Statistical Rigor**: Requirements include all requested rigor: 95% Wilson CIs, sample sizes, p-values, Bonferroni correction, warnings when n < 500
5. **Q5 - Bayesian Scope**: Requirements correctly specify Phase 2 Bayesian as optional augmentation (not replacement)
6. **Q6 - Within-Player Analysis**: Correctly listed as out of scope (future enhancement)
7. **Q7 - Performance**: Requirements note "accuracy over speed" - no performance constraints
8. **Q8 - Migration**: Requirements include CHANGELOG notes, no old results retention, documentation explaining fix
9. **Q9 - Out of Scope**: All items correctly excluded: ML baselines, causal inference, map-specific, real-time updates, automated data collection
10. **Q10 - Code Reuse**: Requirements correctly reference Wilson CI from `src/utils/statistics.py`, character_stats pattern, analyze_characters.py structure
11. **Q11 - Visual Assets**: No visual assets needed (confirmed below)

**Reusability Documentation**: Excellent - Requirements explicitly list three reusability opportunities with specific file paths.

### Check 2: Visual Assets
**Status**: PASS

No visual assets found in planning/visuals folder (as expected). User confirmed "No mockups needed - this is primarily backend/statistical work." Requirements.md correctly omits visual references.

- Test verification: All tasks specify running "only" the newly written tests, not entire suite (COMPLIANT)
- Testing-engineer adds 9-12 tests (6-8 unit + 3-4 integration) which is within 10 max guideline

**Reusability References:**
- Task 1.2: Uses existing Wilson CI function (referenced)
- Task 3.3: Follows character_winrate.py caching pattern (referenced)
- Task 4.6: Follows analyze_characters.py CLI structure (referenced)
- Notes section explicitly lists reuse opportunities with file paths

**Specificity:**
- All tasks reference specific functions to create/modify
- All tasks include specific file paths
- Parameters and return values specified for new functions
- Database column names explicitly listed

**Traceability:**
- Task Group 1: Traces to Requirements Section 1 (New Baseline Models)
- Task Group 2: Traces to Requirements Section 4 (Database Schema)
- Task Group 3: Traces to Requirements Section 2 (Synergy Score Calculation)
- Task Group 4: Traces to Requirements Acceptance Criteria (CLI flags)

- Task Groups 6-7: Trace to Requirements Testing Strategy
- Task Group 8: Traces to Requirements Documentation section

**Scope:**
- No tasks for out-of-scope items (ML baselines, within-player, automation)
- All tasks align with Phase 1 or Phase 2 (optional) requirements

**Task Count per Group:**
- Task Group 1: 8 subtasks (ACCEPTABLE - complex statistical functions)
- Task Group 2: 3 subtasks (GOOD)
- Task Group 3: 9 subtasks (ACCEPTABLE - core refactor is complex)
- Task Group 4: 6 subtasks (GOOD)
- Task Group 5: 3 subtasks (GOOD)
- Task Group 6: 5 subtasks (GOOD)
- Task Group 7: 5 subtasks (GOOD)
- Task Group 8: 5 subtasks (GOOD)
- Task Group 9: 7 subtasks (GOOD)

All groups within 3-10 subtask range.

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check
**Status**: PASS

**Unnecessary New Components:** None identified
- All new code is necessary (no existing synergy analysis to reuse)
- Statistical functions are genuinely new capabilities

**Duplicated Logic:** None identified
- Wilson CI explicitly reused from existing implementation
- Database caching pattern follows existing character_stats approach
- No recreation of existing functionality

**Missing Reuse Opportunities:** None identified
- All three user-mentioned reuse opportunities are documented and referenced in tasks
- Tasks explicitly call out reuse: "Use existing wilson_confidence_interval()" (Task 1.1), "Follow approach from character_winrate.py" (Task 3.7)

**Justification for New Code:**
- New baseline models: Required to fix fundamental flaw
- New significance testing: New capability (didn't exist before)
- New Bayesian functions: Optional enhancement (Phase 2)
- All justified by requirements

**Over-Engineering Assessment:** None detected
- No unnecessary abstractions
- No premature optimization
- Appropriately scoped for problem at hand
- Phase 2 marked as optional (not forced)

---

## Critical Issues
**Status**: NONE

No critical issues identified. Specification and tasks are ready for implementation.

---

## Minor Issues
**Status**: 2 minor observations (not blockers)

1. **Task Group Naming**: Task Group 5 is assigned to "api-engineer" but could be "unassigned" since it's a simple JSON format update. However, this makes sense since it depends on Task Group 3 (api-engineer work), so keeping same assignee ensures continuity.

2. **Documentation Timing**: Task Group 8 could potentially start earlier for some items (README.md updates could be drafted while implementation is ongoing). However, the current approach of documenting after implementation is safer to ensure accuracy.

**Recommendation**: Keep as-is. These are very minor and the current approach is sound.

---

## Standards Compliance

### Test Writing Standards (test-writing.md)
**Status**: COMPLIANT

- Tasks follow "Write Minimal Tests During Development" principle
- Each implementation task group writes 2-8 focused tests only
- Tests focus on core behaviors, not implementation details
- Edge case testing deferred to testing-engineer tasks
- Test verification runs only new tests, not entire suite
- Clear test names and behavior focus emphasized in task descriptions

### Coding Style Standards (coding-style.md)
**Status**: COMPLIANT

- Tasks specify descriptive function names (e.g., `expected_wr_average()`)
- Tasks require comprehensive docstrings explaining rationale
- DRY principle followed (reuse existing Wilson CI)
- Tasks require removal of deprecated code warnings
- Small, focused functions emphasized (each baseline model is separate function)
- No backward compatibility required beyond adding fields (spec Section 7)

### API Standards (api.md)
**Status**: N/A

This is not a REST API feature. It's a CLI script and batch analysis system. No API endpoints created.

### Tech Stack Standards (tech-stack.md)
**Status**: COMPLIANT

Template file is generic. Spec uses appropriate Python libraries:
- scipy.stats (already in requirements.txt)
- numpy (already in requirements.txt)
- No new dependencies added
- PostgreSQL database (presumably already in use)

---

## Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Consider Sample Size Default
**Priority**: Low
**Description**: Requirements show minimum sample size default of 50 games, but user emphasized accuracy over speed and warnings at n < 500. Consider increasing default to 100 games.

**Current**: `--min-sample-size INT` default: 50
**Suggested**: Default: 100

**Rationale**: More conservative threshold reduces noise from very small samples, aligns with user's preference for accuracy.

**Impact**: Very low - users can override with flag if needed.

### Recommendation 2: Add Logging Best Practice
**Priority**: Very Low
**Description**: Task 3.8 adds logging for transparency. Consider adding a subtask to ensure log levels are appropriate (INFO for summary stats, DEBUG for detailed calculations).

**Impact**: Negligible - this is already implied by existing logging patterns.

### Recommendation 3: Power Analysis Examples
**Priority**: Low
**Description**: Task 8.2 documents sample size requirements. Consider adding visual table or chart to make requirements clearer to non-statistical users.

**Impact**: Low - improves user education but not critical for functionality.

## Test Writing Verification

### Test Count Analysis
**Phase 1 Implementation Tasks:**
- Task Group 1.1: 2-4 tests (statistical utilities)
- Task Group 3.1: 2-6 tests (analyzer refactor)
- Subtotal: 4-10 tests during implementation

**Phase 1 Testing-Engineer Tasks:**
- Task Group 6: 6-8 unit tests
- Task Group 7: 3-4 integration tests
- Subtotal: 9-12 additional tests

**Total Phase 1**: 13-22 tests (WELL WITHIN 16-34 guideline)

**Phase 2 (Optional):**
- Task Group 9.1: 2-4 tests
- Total if Phase 2 implemented: 15-26 tests

**Test Verification Approach:**
- Task 1.8: Run ONLY utility tests (2-4 tests)
- Task 3.9: Run ONLY analyzer tests (2-6 tests)
- Task 6.5: Run all unit tests (statistical + analyzer)
- Task 7.5: Run ONLY integration tests (3-4 tests)
- Task 9.7: Run ONLY Bayesian tests (2-4 tests)

**Compliance**: EXCELLENT - All tasks explicitly state "run only" feature-specific tests. No tasks call for "comprehensive" or "exhaustive" testing. Testing is focused and bounded.

## Dependency Verification

### Task Group Dependencies
**Verified Correct:**
1. Task Group 1 (Utilities) has no dependencies - can start immediately
2. Task Group 2 (Database) has no dependencies - can run parallel with TG1
3. Task Group 3 (Analyzer) depends on TG1 - CORRECT
4. Task Group 4 (CLI) depends on TG3 - CORRECT
5. Task Group 5 (Export) depends on TG3 - CORRECT
6. Task Group 6 (Unit Tests) depends on TG1, TG3, TG4 - CORRECT
7. Task Group 7 (Integration) depends on TG6 - CORRECT
8. Task Group 8 (Docs) depends on TG1-7 complete - CORRECT
9. Task Group 9 (Bayesian) depends on Phase 1 complete - CORRECT
