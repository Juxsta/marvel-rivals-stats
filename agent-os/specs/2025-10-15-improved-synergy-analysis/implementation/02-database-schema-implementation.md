# Task 2: Database Schema Updates

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task Group 2 from `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/agent-os/specs/2025-10-15-improved-synergy-analysis/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** database-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** Complete

### Task Description
Update the database schema to support enhanced synergy analysis with statistical significance testing. Add columns for confidence intervals, p-values, sample size warnings, and baseline model tracking to the `synergy_stats` table.

## Implementation Summary
The database schema has been successfully updated to support the new improved synergy analysis methodology. Five new columns were added to the `synergy_stats` table to store statistical metadata (confidence intervals, p-values, warnings, and baseline model information). A partial index was created on the `p_value` column to optimize queries filtering by statistical significance.

The migration follows PostgreSQL best practices with individual columns (not JSONB) for better queryability and performance. The implementation is fully backward compatible - all 102 existing synergy records were preserved, with new columns initialized as NULL (or with the default 'average' value for `baseline_model`). A rollback script was also created to allow safe reversal of the migration if needed.

## Key Implementation Details

### Migration Script Structure
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/migrations/003_add_synergy_statistical_fields.sql`

The migration script adds five new columns to the `synergy_stats` table:

1. `confidence_lower REAL` - Lower bound of 95% Wilson confidence interval for actual win rate
2. `confidence_upper REAL` - Upper bound of 95% Wilson confidence interval for actual win rate
3. `p_value REAL` - P-value from binomial test for statistical significance
4. `sample_size_warning TEXT` - Warning message for insufficient sample sizes
5. `baseline_model TEXT DEFAULT 'average'` - Tracks which baseline model was used for the calculation

The script also creates a partial index on the `p_value` column for efficient queries:
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_synergy_significance
    ON synergy_stats(p_value)
    WHERE p_value IS NOT NULL;
```

**Rationale:** The partial index only includes rows where p_value is not NULL, making it more efficient for queries that filter synergies by statistical significance. The `IF NOT EXISTS` clause ensures idempotency.

### Column Data Types
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/migrations/003_add_synergy_statistical_fields.sql`

All numeric statistical fields use `REAL` type (4-byte floating point) rather than `DECIMAL`:
- Confidence bounds and p-values don't require exact decimal precision
- `REAL` provides better performance for scientific calculations
- Matches PostgreSQL conventions for statistical data

The `sample_size_warning` uses `TEXT` type (unlimited length) rather than `VARCHAR`:
- PostgreSQL treats TEXT and VARCHAR identically for performance
- TEXT provides flexibility for longer warning messages without schema changes
- No length constraints needed for human-readable warning text

**Rationale:** Individual columns were chosen over JSONB because:
1. Better query performance (can use indexes on p_value)
2. Easier to write SQL queries filtering by significance
3. Type safety at database level
4. Clear schema documentation

### Rollback Safety
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/migrations/003_rollback_add_synergy_statistical_fields.sql`

A dedicated rollback script was created following migration best practices:
- Drops the partial index first (before removing columns)
- Removes all new columns with `IF EXISTS` clauses for safety
- Reverts schema_migrations tracking table
- Restores collection_metadata to previous version number

**Rationale:** Separating rollback logic into its own file makes it explicit and testable. The rollback can be executed independently if needed without parsing the forward migration.

## Database Changes

### Migrations
- `003_add_synergy_statistical_fields.sql` - Adds statistical fields to synergy_stats table
  - Added columns: confidence_lower, confidence_upper, p_value, sample_size_warning, baseline_model
  - Added index: idx_synergy_significance (partial index on p_value WHERE p_value IS NOT NULL)
  - Updated schema_migrations table to version 3
  - Updated collection_metadata schema_version to '3'

### Schema Impact
The `synergy_stats` table schema was extended from 11 to 16 columns:

**Before Migration:**
- 11 columns: id, hero_a, hero_b, rank_tier, games_together, wins_together, win_rate, expected_win_rate, synergy_score, statistical_significance, analyzed_at
- 3 indexes: primary key, unique constraint on (hero_a, hero_b, rank_tier), no p_value index

**After Migration:**
- 16 columns: all previous columns plus confidence_lower, confidence_upper, p_value, sample_size_warning, baseline_model
- 3 indexes: previous indexes plus partial index on p_value for significance queries
- 102 existing records preserved with new columns as NULL (except baseline_model = 'average')

**Data Integrity:** All existing data remains unchanged. New columns will be populated when the synergy analysis script runs with the updated methodology.

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies Added
None - migration uses standard PostgreSQL SQL features available in PostgreSQL 16.

### Configuration Changes
- `schema_migrations` table: Added version 3 entry with description "Add statistical fields (confidence intervals, p-values) to synergy_stats"
- `collection_metadata` table: Updated schema_version from '2' to '3'

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
None - database migrations are tested through direct execution against the database.

### Test Coverage
- Migration execution: Complete - Script executed successfully without errors
- Schema verification: Complete - All columns exist with correct types and defaults
- Index verification: Complete - Partial index created successfully
- Data preservation: Complete - All 102 existing records preserved

### Manual Testing Performed
Executed the following verification steps:

1. **Pre-migration state check:**
   - Verified existing synergy_stats schema (11 columns)
   - Confirmed 102 existing records in table
   - Checked current schema_migrations version (2)

2. **Migration execution:**
   - Ran migration script via Docker exec to PostgreSQL container
   - Migration completed with output: `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX`, `INSERT 0 1`, `UPDATE 1`
   - No errors or warnings

3. **Post-migration verification:**
   ```sql
   -- Verified new columns exist with correct types
   \d synergy_stats
   -- Result: All 5 new columns present with correct types

   -- Verified index creation
   SELECT indexname, indexdef FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'synergy_stats';
   -- Result: idx_synergy_significance partial index created

   -- Verified data preservation
   SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records,
          COUNT(confidence_lower) as has_confidence_lower,
          COUNT(p_value) as has_p_value
   FROM synergy_stats;
   -- Result: 102 total records, 0 confidence_lower, 0 p_value (NULL as expected)

   -- Verified default value
   SELECT hero_a, hero_b, baseline_model FROM synergy_stats LIMIT 3;
   -- Result: baseline_model = 'average' for all rows
   ```

4. **Schema version tracking:**
   ```sql
   SELECT version, description FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY version;
   -- Result: Version 3 entry added successfully
   ```

All tests passed successfully. The migration is production-ready.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Database Migration Best Practices (`agent-os/standards/backend/migrations.md`)

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The migration follows all key principles from the migrations standard:

1. **Reversible Migrations** - A dedicated rollback script was created (`003_rollback_add_synergy_statistical_fields.sql`) that safely removes all changes.

2. **Small, Focused Changes** - The migration focuses on a single logical change: adding statistical fields to support improved synergy analysis. No unrelated schema changes were included.

3. **Zero-Downtime Deployments** - All columns are added with `IF NOT EXISTS` and nullable defaults, allowing the application to continue running during migration. Old code can still read/write existing columns.

4. **Separate Schema and Data** - The migration only modifies schema (adds columns and index). No data transformations or updates to existing values (except the default for baseline_model).

5. **Index Management** - The partial index uses `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` to avoid errors on re-runs, and indexes only non-null p_values for efficiency.

6. **Naming Conventions** - Clear, descriptive names used: `idx_synergy_significance` indicates purpose, migration file named `003_add_synergy_statistical_fields.sql` describes what it does.

7. **Version Control** - Migration files committed to version control in the migrations/ directory with sequential numbering (003).

**Deviations:** None - all standards followed.

### Database Model Best Practices (`agent-os/standards/backend/models.md`)

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The schema update follows database modeling best practices:

1. **Clear Naming** - Column names are self-documenting: `confidence_lower`, `confidence_upper`, `p_value`, `sample_size_warning`, `baseline_model`.

2. **Timestamps** - The existing `analyzed_at` timestamp tracks when synergy statistics were calculated (no changes needed).

3. **Data Integrity** - Used appropriate constraints:
   - `REAL` type for floating-point statistical values (confidence bounds, p-values)
   - `TEXT` type for warning messages (flexible length)
   - `DEFAULT 'average'` ensures baseline_model is never null
   - Partial index constraint: `WHERE p_value IS NOT NULL`

4. **Appropriate Data Types** - Selected types matching data purpose:
   - `REAL` for scientific calculations (4-byte float, sufficient precision)
   - `TEXT` for human-readable messages (unlimited length)
   - No unnecessary precision (avoided NUMERIC/DECIMAL for statistical values)

5. **Indexes on Foreign Keys** - Not applicable (no new foreign keys added). The partial index on `p_value` optimizes the most common query pattern (filtering by significance).

6. **Validation at Multiple Layers** - Database-level validation through types and defaults. Application-level validation will be added in Task Group 3 (api-engineer).

7. **Relationship Clarity** - No new relationships added. Existing foreign key relationships preserved.

8. **Avoid Over-Normalization** - Chose individual columns over JSONB for queryability, balancing normalization with practical performance needs.

**Deviations:** None - appropriate data types and constraints applied.

---

### Global Conventions (`agent-os/standards/global/conventions.md`)

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
The implementation follows project conventions:

1. **Consistent Project Structure** - Migration files placed in the standard `migrations/` directory with sequential numbering (001, 002, 003).

2. **Version Control Best Practices** - Clear migration filename (`003_add_synergy_statistical_fields.sql`) describes the change. Ready to commit with descriptive message.

3. **Environment Configuration** - Migration connects using existing `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. No new secrets or configuration required.

4. **Dependency Management** - No new dependencies added. Uses standard PostgreSQL SQL features.

**Deviations:** None - follows established project structure and practices.

---

### Code Commenting Best Practices (`agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md`)

**How Your Implementation Complies:**
Migration SQL files include concise, helpful comments:

1. **Self-Documenting Code** - Column names and SQL structure are clear without excessive comments.

2. **Minimal, helpful comments** - Added comments explaining:
   - Purpose of the migration (header comment)
   - Why partial index is used (`WHERE p_value IS NOT NULL`)
   - Schema version tracking updates

3. **Don't comment changes or fixes** - Comments describe what the migration does (evergreen), not when/why it was created or recent changes.

Example of effective commenting:
```sql
-- Create index for filtering by statistical significance
-- Partial index only includes rows where p_value is not null
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_synergy_significance
    ON synergy_stats(p_value)
    WHERE p_value IS NOT NULL;
```

**Deviations:** None - comments are minimal, helpful, and evergreen.

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
Not applicable - this is a database schema change. API endpoints will be updated in Task Group 3 (Core Synergy Analysis Refactor) by the api-engineer.

### External Services
None - migration runs locally against PostgreSQL database.

### Internal Dependencies
The following components depend on this schema update:

1. **Task Group 3** (Core Synergy Analysis Refactor) - The analyzer will populate these new columns when calculating synergies
2. **Task Group 4** (CLI Script Updates) - CLI will display values from these new columns
3. **Task Group 5** (JSON Export) - Export will include data from these new columns

All dependencies are forward dependencies (other tasks depend on this schema being in place first).

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified. Migration executed successfully and all verification tests passed.

### Limitations
1. **Existing data not backfilled**
   - Description: The 102 existing synergy records have NULL values for the new statistical columns (except baseline_model which defaults to 'average')
   - Impact: Existing cached synergy statistics won't have confidence intervals or p-values until re-analyzed
   - Reason: This is intentional - the new methodology requires recalculation with the updated formulas
   - Future Consideration: The synergy analysis script will repopulate these values when run with the new methodology (Task Group 3)

2. **No application-level validation yet**
   - Description: Database accepts any REAL values for p_value (including values outside [0, 1])
   - Impact: Low - application logic will ensure valid values are inserted
   - Reason: Database constraints kept simple for flexibility
   - Future Consideration: Add CHECK constraint if invalid data becomes an issue

3. **Baseline model tracking limited to string**
   - Description: baseline_model is TEXT with default 'average', but no enum constraint
   - Impact: Potential for typos or invalid model names
   - Reason: Avoided ENUM type for easier future expansion (additive, ML models)
   - Future Consideration: Document valid values in application code and consider CHECK constraint if needed

## Performance Considerations
The migration has minimal performance impact:

1. **Index creation** - The partial index on `p_value` is small (only includes non-null values) and creates quickly
2. **Storage overhead** - Five new columns add approximately 20-24 bytes per row (5 fields × 4-8 bytes each depending on type)
3. **Query performance** - Queries filtering by p_value will be faster with the new partial index
4. **Migration execution time** - Completed in <1 second on the test database with 102 records

For larger datasets:
- Adding columns is instant (PostgreSQL doesn't rewrite the table for nullable columns)
- Index creation scales well (partial index only includes significant results, typically <10% of records)
- No table locks required during migration (columns added with IF NOT EXISTS)

## Security Considerations
No security implications:

- No new user-facing functionality
- No changes to authentication or authorization
- No sensitive data in new columns (statistical metadata only)
- Migration uses existing database credentials
- No SQL injection risks (static SQL, no user input)

The existing security model (database access via DATABASE_URL) remains unchanged.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
This task is a prerequisite for:

1. **Task Group 3** (Core Synergy Analysis Refactor) - REQUIRED
   - Analyzer must write to new columns when calculating synergies
   - Must populate: confidence_lower, confidence_upper, p_value, sample_size_warning, baseline_model

2. **Task Group 4** (CLI Script Updates) - REQUIRED
   - CLI must read new columns to display confidence intervals and significance

3. **Task Group 5** (JSON Export Format Updates) - REQUIRED
   - Export must include new fields in JSON output

All subsequent tasks (6, 7, 8) transitively depend on this schema being in place.

## Notes

### Migration Execution
The migration was executed successfully against the PostgreSQL database running in Docker container `marvel-rivals-postgres`:

```bash
docker exec -i marvel-rivals-postgres psql -U marvel_stats -d marvel_rivals < migrations/003_add_synergy_statistical_fields.sql
```

Output: `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX`, `INSERT 0 1`, `UPDATE 1` (all successful)

### Rollback Instructions
If the migration needs to be reversed:

```bash
docker exec -i marvel-rivals-postgres psql -U marvel_stats -d marvel_rivals < migrations/003_rollback_add_synergy_statistical_fields.sql
```

This will:
1. Drop the `idx_synergy_significance` index
2. Remove all five new columns
3. Revert schema_migrations to version 2
4. Update collection_metadata back to schema_version '2'

### Database Container
The PostgreSQL database is running as Docker container with:
- Container name: `marvel-rivals-postgres`
- PostgreSQL version: 16-alpine
- Port: 5432 (mapped to localhost)
- Database: `marvel_rivals`
- User: `marvel_stats`

### Schema Evolution
This is the third migration in the project:
- Version 1: Initial schema (players, matches, stats tables)
- Version 2: Performance indexes
- **Version 3: Statistical fields for improved synergy analysis** (this migration)

### Next Steps for Other Engineers
For the **api-engineer** implementing Task Group 3:

1. Import the updated schema knowledge in the analyzer
2. Calculate confidence intervals using existing `wilson_confidence_interval()` utility
3. Calculate p-values using new `binomial_test_synergy()` function (from Task Group 1)
4. Populate all five new columns in the `cache_synergy_stats()` function
5. Handle NULL values gracefully when reading from existing cached results

For the **testing-engineer** implementing Task Groups 6 & 7:

1. Test database caching includes all new columns
2. Verify NULL handling for existing cached records
3. Confirm new analyses populate all statistical fields
4. Validate partial index improves query performance for significance filtering
