**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Assignee**: Self (main orchestrator)
**Date**: 2025-10-15

---

## Summary

Successfully updated all documentation to reflect the v2.0 synergy analysis methodology change. Created comprehensive migration guide and troubleshooting entries to help users understand why results changed and what the limitations are with current data.

---

## Tasks Completed

### 8.1 Update README.md with Methodology Note ✅

**File**: `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/README.md:110-132`

**Changes**:
- Added v2.0 methodology note to Step 4: Analyze Teammate Synergies section
- Documented new formula: `synergy_score = actual_win_rate - expected_win_rate` where `expected_win_rate = (hero_a_wr + hero_b_wr) / 2`
- Added highlighted note explaining the v2.0 fix:
  > **Note**: v2.0 methodology (Oct 2025) fixed a fundamental flaw in the baseline model. Previous versions used a multiplicative baseline that inflated synergy scores to ±25-30%. The new average baseline produces realistic ±3-7% synergies with proper statistical testing.

- Updated Documentation section with new links:
  - [Synergy Analysis Migration Guide](docs/MIGRATION_SYNERGY_V2.md)
  - Updated [Statistical Methodology](docs/STATISTICS.md) reference

### 8.2 Update STATISTICS.md ✅

**File**: `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/docs/STATISTICS.md:86-172`

**Changes**:
- Replaced entire "Synergy Score Calculation" section with new "Synergy Analysis Methodology (v2.0)" section
- Added subsections:
  - **Average Baseline Model**: Formula and rationale
  - **Why Not Multiplicative? (v1.0 Flaw)**: Explains the mathematical error with example
  - **Synergy Score Calculation**: Interpretation guide (+/0/-5%)
  - **Example (v2.0 Methodology)**: Hulk + Luna Snow worked example with CI and p-value
  - **Statistical Enhancements (v2.0)**: 5 new features listed
  - **Sample Size Requirements**: Table showing 1,692/606/149 games needed for 3%/5%/10% detection
  - **Confidence Levels**: High (≥500), Medium (100-499), Low (<100)
  - **Limitations**: Honest assessment of current data constraints

- Updated Changelog section (line 276-278):
  - Added v2.0 entry: Fixed synergy baseline flaw, added statistical testing
  - Kept v1.0 entry with note that synergy methodology was later found to be flawed

### 8.3 Create MIGRATION_SYNERGY_V2.md ✅

**File**: `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/docs/MIGRATION_SYNERGY_V2.md` (new file, 306 lines)

**Structure**:
1. **TL;DR**: Quick summary of what/why/impact/action
2. **Why Did Results Change?**: Explains the flaw and the fix
3. **Before vs. After Comparison**:
   - Hulk + Luna Snow example table
   - Visual comparison of top 5 results (v1.0 vs v2.0)
4. **What Stayed the Same?**: Rankings, database schema, collection pipeline
5. **What Changed?**: 5 major changes detailed
6. **FAQ**: 8 common questions answered
   - Are old results wrong? (Yes)
   - Should I trust new results? (Yes, with caveats)
   - Which pairs are truly synergistic? (Hard to say with current data)
   - Why can't I detect small synergies? (Statistical power)
   - Should I ignore synergy analysis? (No - relative ordering still useful)
   - Will synergies become significant with more data? (Maybe - power analysis shows requirements)
   - Can I still use old methodology? (No - removed)
   - How do I interpret the new output? (Look for score/CI/p-value/warning)
7. **Technical Details**: Formulas and statistical testing methodology
8. **Migration Checklist**: 7 action items
9. **Summary**: Key achievements of v2.0

**Tone**: Educational, transparent about limitations, builds trust by being honest about uncertainty

### 8.4 Update troubleshooting.md ✅

**File**: `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/docs/troubleshooting.md` (appended 3 entries)

**Added Entries**:

1. **"Why Did Synergy Scores Decrease After Updating?"** (lines 207-225)
   - Explains v2.0 methodology fix
   - Before/after example
   - Reassures rankings are similar
   - Links to MIGRATION_SYNERGY_V2.md

2. **"What Does 'Insufficient Sample Size' Warning Mean?"** (lines 227-244)
   - Explains confidence levels (high/medium/low)
   - Power analysis reference
   - Recommends collecting more data
   - Notes that relative ordering still useful

3. **"No Synergies Are Statistically Significant"** (lines 246-263)
   - Explains why (small true effects + moderate sample sizes)
   - Power analysis showing requirements
   - Encourages data collection
   - Notes that trends still informative

### 8.5 Create CHANGELOG.md Entry ✅

**File**: `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/CHANGELOG.md` (new file, 183 lines)

**Structure**:

**[2.0.0] - 2025-10-15**
