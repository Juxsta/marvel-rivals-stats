# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description

Improve the Marvel Rivals Stats Analyzer synergy detection methodology.

## Context

We've just completed a comprehensive statistical analysis that revealed:

1. **Current methodology is flawed**: The multiplicative model for expected win rates is theoretically unsound
2. **Sample sizes are insufficient**: Need 10,000+ matches to detect realistic 3-5% synergies
3. **No statistical significance**: With current data (286 matches), zero synergies are statistically significant using proper methods
4. **Multiple approaches available**: 5 strategies identified to improve detection

## Raw Idea/Requirement

Improve the synergy analysis system to:
- Fix the methodological flaw (replace multiplicative with additive/average baseline)
- Implement better statistical methods (Bayesian, within-player analysis)
- Add power analysis and sample size calculations
- Provide honest uncertainty quantification
- Support continuous data collection for reaching significance
