# Task 5: Database Scripts Implementation

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #5 from `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/agent-os/specs/20251015-project-scaffolding/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** database-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** Complete

### Task Description
This task implements all database initialization and management scripts needed for the Marvel Rivals Stats project, including database initialization, migration management, sample data seeding, and comprehensive testing.

## Implementation Summary
All database scripts were successfully implemented with robust error handling, clear user feedback, and parameterized queries following security best practices. The implementation includes:

1. **init_db.py** - A comprehensive database initialization script that intelligently manages migrations by tracking already-applied versions in the schema_migrations table and only running new migrations
2. **run_migration.py** - A standalone migration runner for manual database schema updates with transaction management and rollback support
3. **seed_sample_data.py** - A data seeding script that populates the database with realistic Marvel Rivals test data including players across different rank tiers, complete matches, and participant statistics
4. **test_seed_data.py** - Test suite validating the seed script's functionality and data integrity

All scripts follow the project's coding standards with parameterized queries for SQL injection prevention, comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation, and clear status reporting for users.

## Key Implementation Details

### init_db.py Script
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/scripts/init_db.py`

The init_db.py script provides intelligent database initialization with the following features:

- **Migration Version Tracking**: Queries the schema_migrations table to determine which migrations have already been applied
- **Selective Migration Application**: Only runs migrations with version numbers higher than the current database version
- **Migration File Discovery**: Automatically finds all .sql files in the migrations/ directory and sorts them numerically
- **Schema Verification**: After applying migrations, verifies all 7 expected tables exist (schema_migrations, players, matches, match_participants, character_stats, synergy_stats, collection_metadata)
- **Clear User Feedback**: Provides visual status indicators (checkmark, X, circled X) for each operation
- **Error Handling**: Rolls back failed migrations and exits with appropriate error codes

**Rationale:** This approach allows the script to be run repeatedly without causing errors (idempotent operation), which is essential for both development and production deployment scenarios.

### run_migration.py Script
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/scripts/run_migration.py`

The run_migration.py script enables manual migration execution with these capabilities:

- **CLI Interface**: Accepts migration file path as command-line argument with clear usage instructions
- **File Validation**: Checks migration file existence before attempting execution
- **Transaction Management**: Wraps migration execution in a transaction with automatic rollback on error
- **Error Reporting**: Provides detailed error messages distinguishing between database errors and unexpected failures
- **Connection Safety**: Ensures database connection is closed in all scenarios using try/finally blocks

**Rationale:** While init_db.py handles batch migrations, this script provides granular control for applying specific migrations during development or debugging scenarios.

### seed_sample_data.py Script
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/scripts/seed_sample_data.py`

The seed_sample_data.py script generates realistic test data:

- **Realistic Player Data**: Creates 5 sample players with actual Marvel character-inspired usernames, distributed across Diamond, Platinum, and Gold rank tiers
- **Complete Match Data**: Inserts 3 competitive matches with proper timestamps and season information
- **Match Participant Details**: Creates 15 participant records (5 per match) with realistic KDA statistics, damage/healing values, hero names, roles, and team assignments
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Uses ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING clauses to allow script re-runs without errors
- **Data Verification**: Queries and reports final record counts after seeding
- **Marvel Rivals Authenticity**: Uses actual hero names from the game (Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, Captain America, Hawkeye, Star-Lord, Luna Snow)

**Rationale:** Realistic test data is crucial for validating analysis algorithms and ensuring the application can handle real-world data patterns.

### test_seed_data.py Tests
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/tests/test_db/test_seed_data.py`

Created 3 focused tests following the project's minimal testing standards:

1. **test_seed_script_creates_records**: Verifies the seed script inserts the expected minimum number of records (5 players, 3 matches, 15 participants)
2. **test_seed_data_foreign_keys_valid**: Validates all foreign key relationships are intact (all match_participants reference valid matches and players)
3. **test_seed_data_has_realistic_values**: Ensures seeded data contains valid role values (vanguard/duelist/strategist), valid team assignments (0 or 1), and that players have rank tiers

**Rationale:** These tests focus on critical data integrity concerns without over-testing implementation details, aligning with the project's philosophy of minimal strategic testing.

## Database Changes (if applicable)

### Migrations
No new migrations created. This task utilizes existing migrations:
- `001_initial_schema.sql` - Creates all 7 core tables
- `002_add_indexes.sql` - Creates 11 performance indexes

### Schema Impact
No schema changes. Scripts operate on existing schema to initialize, migrate, and populate data.

## Dependencies (if applicable)

### New Dependencies Added
None. Uses existing dependencies:
- `psycopg2-binary` - PostgreSQL database adapter
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management
- `pytest` - Testing framework (dev dependency)

### Configuration Changes
No configuration changes required. Scripts use existing DATABASE_URL environment variable from .env file.

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/tests/test_db/test_seed_data.py` - New file with 3 tests validating seed data functionality

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: Complete (3 focused tests for seed data validation)
- Integration tests: Covered through script execution testing
- Edge cases covered:
  - Foreign key validation
  - Data type constraints (role, team)
  - Duplicate handling (ON CONFLICT clauses)

### Manual Testing Performed
Executed comprehensive manual validation:

1. **Database Initialization Testing**:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec app python scripts/init_db.py
   ```
   Result: Successfully verified all 7 tables, correctly skipped already-applied migrations, reported schema version 2

2. **Sample Data Seeding Testing**:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec app python scripts/seed_sample_data.py
   ```
   Result: Successfully inserted 5 players, 3 matches, 15 match participants with no errors

3. **Automated Test Execution**:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec app pytest tests/test_db/test_seed_data.py -v
   ```
   Result: All 3 tests passed in 0.05 seconds

4. **Data Verification**:
   Manually queried database to confirm:
   - All foreign key relationships intact
   - Data values within expected ranges
   - Hero roles match Marvel Rivals game roles
   - Match participants properly distributed across teams

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Backend - Queries (queries.md)
**File Reference:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/agent-os/standards/backend/queries.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
All database scripts use parameterized queries exclusively. For example, in seed_sample_data.py, all INSERT statements use `%s` placeholders with values passed as tuples: `cur.execute("INSERT INTO players (username, rank_tier, rank_score...) VALUES (%s, %s, %s...)", (username, rank_tier, rank_score...))`. This prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities. Scripts also select only needed columns and use transactions to maintain data consistency.

**Deviations:** None

### Backend - Migrations (migrations.md)
**File Reference:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/agent-os/standards/backend/migrations.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
The migration system tracks version history through the schema_migrations table, uses clear descriptive names (001_initial_schema.sql, 002_add_indexes.sql), and separates schema changes from data operations. The init_db.py script ensures migrations are applied in order and can be safely re-run without side effects.

**Deviations:** The project uses a simple manual migration system without automatic rollback functionality, as per the architectural decision documented in the spec (overhead not justified for small project scope).

### Global - Error Handling (error-handling.md)
**File Reference:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
All scripts implement comprehensive error handling with try/except/finally blocks. Database errors use specific psycopg2.Error exceptions. Failed migrations trigger rollback (conn.rollback()) before exiting. All database connections are properly closed in finally blocks to prevent resource leaks. User-facing error messages are clear and actionable without exposing sensitive technical details.

**Deviations:** None

### Global - Validation (validation.md)
**File Reference:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Scripts fail fast with explicit error messages. For example, run_migration.py validates the migration file exists before attempting to execute it. Seed data includes database-level constraints validation (CHECK constraints for roles and teams) which are enforced by the schema.

**Deviations:** None

### Testing - Test Writing (test-writing.md)
**File Reference:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
Created only 3 strategic tests focused on core user flows (seed data creation, foreign key integrity, data validity). Tests verify behavior (data exists and is valid) rather than implementation details. Edge cases and error handling are not exhaustively tested, aligning with the "minimal tests during development" principle. Tests execute quickly (0.05 seconds total).

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points (if applicable)

### Internal Dependencies
- `src.db.connection` module: All scripts use get_connection() for database access
- Migration SQL files in `migrations/` directory: init_db.py discovers and executes these
- Environment configuration (.env file): Scripts load DATABASE_URL and related variables

### Database Schema Dependencies
- Depends on schema_migrations table for version tracking
- Operates on all 7 core tables (players, matches, match_participants, character_stats, synergy_stats, collection_metadata)
- Relies on foreign key constraints between match_participants -> matches and match_participants -> players

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified. All acceptance criteria met and tests passing.

### Limitations
1. **No Automatic Rollback**
   - Description: Migration system does not support automatic rollback to previous versions
   - Reason: Manual migration approach chosen for simplicity and transparency
   - Future Consideration: Could add rollback SQL files (e.g., 001_initial_schema_down.sql) if needed

2. **Seed Data Hardcoded**
   - Description: Sample data uses hardcoded values rather than randomization
   - Reason: Provides predictable, repeatable test data for development
   - Future Consideration: Could add optional randomization parameters for larger datasets

3. **Single Database URL Support**
   - Description: Scripts only support DATABASE_URL environment variable
   - Reason: Simplified configuration for Docker environment
   - Future Consideration: Already handles both DATABASE_URL and individual parameters in connection.py module

## Performance Considerations
- Scripts use single database connections (not connection pooling) which is appropriate for infrequent administrative operations
- Seed script inserts data in small batches (5 players, 3 matches, 15 participants) completing in <1 second
- Migration execution time scales linearly with SQL complexity; current migrations complete in <2 seconds
- Test suite executes in 0.05 seconds, well below the "fast test" guideline

## Security Considerations
- All SQL queries use parameterized statements preventing SQL injection
- Database credentials loaded from environment variables, never hardcoded
- No sensitive data logged or exposed in error messages
- Scripts run with same permissions as application, not elevated privileges

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
- Task Group 7 (Integration Testing): Will use these scripts to set up test database state
- Task Group 8 (Documentation): Will document script usage in deployment guides
- Future Phase 1 tasks: Data collection scripts will build upon this seeded data structure

## Notes
- The scripts were already implemented when this task was assigned; the primary work was verification, testing, and documentation
- All scripts successfully tested in Docker environment confirming they work in the target deployment context
- Seed data uses authentic Marvel Rivals hero names and game mechanics (roles: vanguard/duelist/strategist, teams: 0/1)
- Scripts are idempotent and can be safely re-run without causing errors or duplicate data
- Clear visual feedback (checkmark, X symbols) provides excellent developer experience
- Implementation aligns with project philosophy: simple, transparent, sufficient for scope
