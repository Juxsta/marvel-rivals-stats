# Task 6: API Integration Setup

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #6 from `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/agent-os/specs/20251015-project-scaffolding/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** api-engineer
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
This task implements the API client layer with rate limiting infrastructure for the Marvel Rivals Stats Analyzer project. This is scaffolding phase implementation - the client methods are stubs that will be fully implemented in Phase 1 (data collection).

## Implementation Summary
Created a complete API client infrastructure with three main components:
1. **RateLimiter** - Thread-safe token bucket rate limiter to respect API constraints
2. **MarvelRivalsClient** - API client with method stubs for future implementation
3. **Test suite** - 3 focused tests validating client initialization and structure

The implementation prioritizes clean separation of concerns by extracting rate limiting into its own module, making it reusable and testable. The client design follows the project's standards for error handling, using environment variables for configuration, and providing clear documentation for future implementation.

## Key Implementation Details

### Rate Limiter Module
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/src/api/rate_limiter.py`

Implemented a thread-safe rate limiter using the token bucket algorithm:
- Configurable requests per minute (default: 7)
- Thread-safe using `threading.Lock()`
- `wait_if_needed()` method blocks if rate limit would be exceeded
- `get_delay()` helper method returns minimum delay between requests

**Rationale:** Separating rate limiting into its own module provides better testability and reusability. The token bucket algorithm is simple and effective for API rate limiting. Thread safety ensures the rate limiter works correctly in concurrent scenarios.

### API Client Stub
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/src/api/client.py`

Refactored existing `MarvelRivalsAPI` class into `MarvelRivalsClient` with:
- Constructor that accepts API key and rate limit configuration
- Reads from environment variables if parameters not provided
- Integrates with `RateLimiter` instance
- Three stub methods that raise `NotImplementedError`:
  - `get_player_profile(username)`
  - `get_player_matches(username, limit=150)`
  - `get_match_details(match_id)`

**Rationale:** Using `NotImplementedError` makes it explicit that these are stubs for future implementation. Reading from environment variables provides flexibility for different deployment environments. The design allows for easy extension in Phase 1 without breaking the interface.

### Test Suite
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/tests/test_api/test_client.py`

Created 3 focused tests:
1. `test_client_initializes_with_api_key` - Verifies basic initialization
2. `test_rate_limiter_initializes` - Confirms rate limiter is created
3. `test_client_has_expected_methods` - Validates method signatures exist

**Rationale:** These tests focus on structural validation rather than behavior, appropriate for scaffolding phase. They ensure the client can be imported and instantiated, which is all that's needed before actual API implementation.

### Test API Script
**Location:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/scripts/test_api.py`

Updated to:
- Use new `MarvelRivalsClient` class name
- Display client configuration (rate limit, delay, masked API key)
- Print helpful note that actual API calls will be implemented in Phase 1

**Rationale:** Provides a simple way to verify the client initialization works in the Docker environment without needing actual API calls.

## Database Changes (if applicable)
No database changes were required for this task.

## Dependencies (if applicable)

### New Dependencies Added
None - all required dependencies were already in `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`

### Configuration Changes
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to mount `/tests` directory for test execution in container

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/tests/test_api/test_client.py` - 3 initialization tests

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete (3 tests covering initialization and structure)
- Integration tests: ⚠️ None needed (scaffolding phase - no actual API calls)
- Edge cases covered:
  - Client initialization with explicit API key
  - Rate limiter creation and configuration
  - Method existence validation

### Manual Testing Performed
Executed the following verification steps:

1. **Container restart with new volume mounts:**
   ```bash
   docker compose down && docker compose up -d
   ```
   Result: Services started successfully, tests directory mounted

2. **Run test suite:**
   ```bash
   docker compose exec app pytest tests/test_api/ -v
   ```
   Result: All 3 tests passed

3. **Run test_api.py script:**
   ```bash
   docker compose exec app python scripts/test_api.py
   ```
   Result: Client initialized successfully, configuration displayed correctly

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Backend API Standards
**File Reference:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/agent-os/standards/backend/api.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Rate limiting headers ready for implementation: The `RateLimiter` class tracks request timing and can be extended to provide rate limit information in headers when actual API implementation occurs in Phase 1.
- Clear, consistent naming: Used `MarvelRivalsClient` following the project's naming conventions, with descriptive method names like `get_player_profile`, `get_player_matches`.

**Deviations:** None

### Global Coding Style Standards
**File Reference:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Meaningful names: Class names (`MarvelRivalsClient`, `RateLimiter`) and method names clearly describe their purpose
- Small, focused functions: Each method has a single responsibility (e.g., `wait_if_needed()` only handles rate limiting delay)
- DRY principle: Extracted rate limiting logic into reusable `RateLimiter` class rather than duplicating in client
- Removed dead code: Deleted the old `MarvelRivalsAPI` implementation that had actual API call logic (not needed for scaffolding)

**Deviations:** None

### Global Error Handling Standards
**File Reference:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Fail fast and explicitly: Client raises `ValueError` immediately if API key is not provided, preventing invalid state
- Specific exception types: Uses `NotImplementedError` for stub methods, making it clear these need implementation
- User-friendly messages: Error messages in stub methods clearly state "will be implemented in Phase 1 (data collection)"

**Deviations:** None

### Test Writing Standards
**File Reference:** `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Write minimal tests during development: Created only 3 focused tests for initialization, not comprehensive coverage
- Test behavior, not implementation: Tests validate that client can be initialized and has expected methods, not internal implementation details
- Clear test names: Test names like `test_client_initializes_with_api_key` clearly describe what's being tested
- Mock external dependencies: No actual API calls made - tests only verify structure

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points (if applicable)

### APIs/Endpoints
None yet - stubs only. Future Phase 1 implementation will integrate with:
- `GET https://marvelrivalsapi.com/api/v1/player/{username}` - Player profile
- `GET https://marvelrivalsapi.com/api/v1/player/{username}/match-history` - Match history
- `GET https://marvelrivalsapi.com/api/v2/match/{match_id}` - Match details (assumed endpoint)

### External Services
- Marvel Rivals API (marvelrivalsapi.com) - not yet integrated, will be in Phase 1

### Internal Dependencies
- `src.api.rate_limiter.RateLimiter` - Used by client for rate limiting
- Environment variables: `MARVEL_RIVALS_API_KEY`, `RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None

### Limitations
1. **Stub Implementation Only**
   - Description: All API methods raise `NotImplementedError`
   - Reason: Scaffolding phase - actual API integration will be implemented in Phase 1
   - Future Consideration: Replace NotImplementedError with actual API calls in Phase 1

2. **No Retry Logic**
   - Description: Rate limiter doesn't implement retry strategies for transient failures
   - Reason: Not needed for scaffolding; actual API calls will implement retry logic
   - Future Consideration: Add exponential backoff in Phase 1 when implementing real API calls

## Performance Considerations
The `RateLimiter` uses thread locks which could become a bottleneck in highly concurrent scenarios. For the expected usage (7 requests/minute), this is not a concern. If concurrent requests increase significantly in the future, consider:
- Using semaphores instead of locks
- Implementing a token bucket with actual tokens
- Using async/await patterns with asyncio locks

## Security Considerations
- API key is read from environment variables, not hardcoded
- API key is masked in output (shows only last 4 characters)
- No sensitive data is logged or exposed in error messages
- Rate limiting helps prevent accidental API abuse

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
The following tasks depend on this implementation:
- Task 7 (Integration Testing) - will test integration between API client and database
- Future Phase 1 tasks - will implement actual API call logic in the stub methods

## Notes
- The `docker-compose.yml` version warning can be ignored - it's a Docker Compose v2 compatibility notice
- Tests directory mounting required container recreation (restart was insufficient)
- The implementation follows the project's philosophy of "minimal tests during development" with only 3 focused tests
- API client is ready for Phase 1 implementation with clear extension points (stub methods)
