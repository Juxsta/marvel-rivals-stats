## Summary

Successfully completed version control finalization:

1. **Git Initialization**: Initialized repository with main branch
2. **File Staging**: Staged all 93 project files, verified sensitive files are gitignored
3. **Comprehensive Commit**: Created detailed commit with proper attribution (dfcb16e)
4. **GitHub Repository**: Created public repository at https://github.com/Juxsta/marvel-rivals-stats
5. **Push**: Successfully pushed all code to GitHub
6. **Verification**: Confirmed repository is accessible and properly configured

The repository is now:
- Publicly accessible
- Well-organized with clear structure
- Properly gitignored (sensitive files excluded)
- Ready for collaboration
- Ready for deployment to Odin server

## Repository Statistics

- **Total Files**: 93
