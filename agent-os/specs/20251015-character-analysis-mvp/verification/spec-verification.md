---

## Technical Accuracy

### Stratified Sampling Quotas
Rank quotas from requirements.md (lines 36-43):
- Bronze: 50, Silver: 75, Gold: 100, Platinum: 100, Diamond: 75, Master: 50, Grandmaster: 25, Celestial: 25
- **Total: 500 players** - Correct
- Distribution appropriate for rank population (oversamples mid-ranks where most players reside)

### Rate Limits
- Requirements.md: 7 requests/minute, 10,000 requests/day (line 64)
- Spec.md: 7 req/min (lines 34, 665-666), enforced with 8.6s delay (line 218)
- Tasks.md: 8.6s delay between requests (line 376)
- **Calculation: 60s / 7 req = 8.57s ≈ 8.6s** - Correct

### Sample Size Thresholds
- Per-rank win rates: Minimum 30 games (consistent in requirements line 72, spec line 329, tasks line 432)
- Overall win rates: Minimum 100 games (consistent in requirements line 73, spec line 329, tasks line 543)
- Synergy analysis: Minimum 50 games together (consistent in requirements line 105, spec line 499, tasks line 678)
- **All thresholds consistent across documents** - Correct

### Statistical Methods
Wilson confidence interval formula (requirements.md lines 224-238, spec.md lines 463-487):
- Uses scipy.stats.norm.ppf for z-score
- Formula: `(p + z²/2n) / (1 + z²/n) ± z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n + z²/4n²) / (1 + z²/n)`
- Handles edge case: total == 0 returns (0.0, 0.0)
- **Formula mathematically correct** - Verified against Wikipedia reference

### Synergy Score Calculation
Formula (requirements.md lines 242-249, spec.md lines 559-566):
- `actual_win_rate = wins_together / games_together`
- `expected_win_rate = hero_a_win_rate * hero_b_win_rate`
- `synergy_score = actual_win_rate - expected_win_rate`
- **Formula correct** - Assumes independence for baseline expectation

### Database Tables Referenced
All tables exist in SPEC-004 schema (verified in `/home/ericreyes/github/marvel-rivals-stats/agent-os/specs/20251015-project-scaffolding/implementation/04-database-setup-implementation.md`):
- players (line 42)
- matches (line 43)
- match_participants (line 44)
- character_stats (line 45)
- synergy_stats (line 46)
- collection_metadata (line 47)
- **All referenced tables exist** - Correct

### API Integration Design
Assumed API endpoints (spec.md lines 624-662):
- GET /api/v1/leaderboard?rank={tier}&limit={n}
- GET /api/v1/leaderboard/hero/{hero_id}?limit={n}
- GET /api/v1/players/{username}/matches?limit={n}
- **Assumptions clearly documented** - Marked as "Assumed" and noted as needing verification (spec.md line 921)

## Risk Coverage

All major risks identified with mitigations:

### API Rate Limits (High Severity, Medium Probability)
- Risk: Requirements.md line 322 - "API rate limits prevent data collection"
- Mitigation: 8.6s enforced delay, exponential backoff, 24-hour distribution
- **Adequately addressed**

### Insufficient Sample Sizes (Medium Severity, High Probability)
- Risk: Requirements.md line 323 - "Insufficient sample sizes for rare heroes"
- Mitigation: Document sample sizes, filter low-confidence results, consider extending collection
- **Adequately addressed**

### Stale Rank Data (Medium Severity, Medium Probability)
- Risk: Requirements.md line 324 - "Player rank data becomes stale"
- Mitigation: Accept for MVP, plan periodic re-collection
- **Adequately addressed**

### API Endpoint Assumptions (High Severity, Medium Probability)
- Risk: Requirements.md line 325 - "API endpoint structure is incorrect"
- Mitigation: Mock API for testing, comprehensive error handling, validate with 5-player test
- **Adequately addressed**

### Database Disk Space (Low Severity, Low Probability)
- Risk: Requirements.md line 326 - "Database fills disk space"
- Mitigation: Monitor disk usage, implement retention policy, estimate 50GB for 75k matches
- **Adequately addressed**

### Statistical Bugs (High Severity, Low Probability)
- Risk: Requirements.md line 327 - "Statistical calculations have bugs"
- Mitigation: Use scipy library, add unit tests, manual verification
- **Adequately addressed**

All high-severity risks have concrete mitigation strategies. No critical risks missing mitigation plans.

## Issues Found

**None.** All checks passed.

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Consider Mock API Server for Testing
The specification assumes Marvel Rivals API structure without verification (spec.md line 921). Consider creating a mock API server (FastAPI or Flask) that implements the assumed endpoints to enable testing before real API access.

**Priority:** Medium
**Effort:** 2-3 hours

### 2. Add Database Backup Strategy
With 50,000+ matches collected over 24 hours, a mid-collection database failure would require restarting. Consider adding periodic database backups or checkpointing.

**Priority:** Low (resumable collection mitigates this)
**Effort:** 1 hour

### 3. Document Expected Win Rate Assumption
The synergy analysis assumes hero win rates are independent (requirements.md line 245). This is a significant statistical assumption that should be documented in user-facing output to prevent misinterpretation.

**Priority:** Low (already documented in spec, consider adding to JSON export metadata)
**Effort:** 30 minutes

### 4. Pre-verify scipy Installation
Task 1.1 adds scipy==1.11.4 to requirements.txt. Consider pre-verifying compatibility with Python 3.10+ in Docker environment to avoid surprises during implementation.

**Priority:** Low (scipy is mature and well-supported)
**Effort:** 10 minutes

## Detailed Findings

### Structural Excellence
The specification demonstrates exceptional organization:
- Clear separation of concerns (discovery → collection → analysis → synergy)
- Detailed algorithms with pseudocode for all phases
- Comprehensive SQL queries and database design
- Well-documented statistical methodology with academic references

### Testing Approach Alignment
The specification perfectly aligns with the project's minimal testing philosophy:
- Total of 20-28 tests across entire feature (10-18 from development + up to 10 integration)
- Testing-engineer explicitly limited to maximum 10 tests (task 7.3)
- Test verification runs ONLY newly written tests, not entire suite (tasks 2.9, 3.11, 4.10, 5.11)
- Focus on critical paths and statistical correctness, not comprehensive coverage

### Statistical Rigor
The specification shows strong statistical foundations:
- Wilson score confidence intervals (more accurate than normal approximation for small samples)
- Appropriate sample size thresholds (30/100/50) balancing power with availability
- Clear documentation of assumptions (independence for synergy baseline)
- References to Wikipedia and academic sources

### Implementation Practicality
Task breakdown is realistic and actionable:
- 53 subtasks across 8 task groups
- 40-54 hours total (3 weeks part-time)
- Clear role assignments (database-engineer, api-engineer, testing-engineer)
- Even workload distribution (16-21 hours per specialist role)
- Specific file paths, function names, and SQL queries provided

### Consolidation Quality
SPEC-005 successfully unifies three previous specs:
- All features from SPEC-001, SPEC-002, SPEC-003 included
- New synergy analysis feature seamlessly integrated
- Unified data pipeline architecture
- Consistent terminology and database schema
- No contradictions or omissions

### Risk Management
Risk assessment is comprehensive and realistic:
- 6 risks identified with severity/probability ratings
- All high-severity risks have concrete mitigation strategies
- Mitigation strategies are practical and implementable
- Trade-offs clearly documented (e.g., accepting stale rank data for MVP)

### Documentation Quality
All three documents (requirements.md, spec.md, tasks.md) are:
- Well-formatted with clear section headers
- Internally consistent
- Cross-referenced appropriately
- Sufficiently detailed without being overwhelming
- Professional and suitable for handoff to implementers

### API Assumptions
The specification makes clear assumptions about the Marvel Rivals API structure (spec.md lines 624-662). These assumptions are:
- Clearly marked as "Assumed"
- Documented in multiple places (requirements, spec, tasks)
- Flagged as needing verification (open question in spec.md line 921)
- Mitigated with mock API testing strategy

This is appropriate for an MVP where API access may not be available during specification phase.

## Summary

**VERIFICATION STATUS: PASSED**

SPEC-005 is complete, consistent, technically accurate, and ready for implementation. The specification successfully consolidates three previous specs (SPEC-001, SPEC-002, SPEC-003) into a unified data pipeline while adding a new synergy analysis feature. All requirements are traceable through spec.md to tasks.md. Test writing limits are properly enforced (20-28 tests maximum). Database schema is consistent with SPEC-004. Statistical methodology is rigorous with proper confidence intervals and sample size thresholds. Risk mitigation strategies are comprehensive. No critical issues identified.

**KEY FINDINGS:**
- Total tests: 20-28 (compliant with minimal testing philosophy)
- All original specs represented: 100%
- Critical path clearly defined: Task Groups 1→2→3→4→5→7→8
- Database schema consistent: All tables from SPEC-004 referenced correctly
- Statistical methods validated: Wilson score formula mathematically correct
- Rate limits accurate: 7 req/min = 8.6s delay
- Sample sizes appropriate: 30/100/50 thresholds balance power with availability
- Timeline realistic: 40-54 hours across 3 weeks part-time

**RECOMMENDATION:** Proceed with implementation. Consider adding mock API server for testing before real API access (medium priority, 2-3 hours effort).
