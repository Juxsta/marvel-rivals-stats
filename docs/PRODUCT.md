# Marvel Rivals Stats - Product Overview

## Vision

A data-driven tool for Marvel Rivals players to understand character performance, identify winning team compositions, and make informed strategic decisions based on statistical analysis of real match data.

## Mission Statement

Provide the Marvel Rivals community with accurate, statistically significant insights into:
- Character win rates across all skill levels
- Team composition synergies and counter-strategies
- Meta trends and optimal hero pairings
- Data-driven recommendations for team building

## Target Users

### Primary Audience
- **Competitive Players**: Looking to optimize team compositions and hero selections
- **Content Creators**: Need data for tier lists, guides, and meta analysis
- **Team Coaches**: Want evidence-based strategies for organized play

### Secondary Audience
- **Casual Players**: Interested in understanding which heroes perform well
- **Game Analysts**: Studying game balance and meta evolution
- **Community Leaders**: Sharing insights with their communities

## Core Value Propositions

1. **Statistical Rigor**: Minimum sample sizes, confidence intervals, significance testing
2. **Rank-Stratified Analysis**: Separate insights for different skill levels (Bronze → Celestial)
3. **Actionable Insights**: Not just "what wins" but "what wins together"
4. **Community-Driven**: Built on real player data, not just theory
5. **Transparency**: Open methodology, reproducible results

## Key Features

### Phase 1: Character Analysis (MVP)
- Character win rates by rank tier
- Performance metrics (K/D, damage, healing)
- Sample size and confidence intervals
- Export to JSON for integration

**User Story**: *"As a competitive player, I want to know which characters have the highest win rates at my rank so I can make informed picks."*

### Phase 2: Team Synergies
- Pair-wise synergy analysis (which heroes win more together)
- Role-based synergies (best tank for each support)
- Statistical significance testing
- Synergy scores (actual vs expected win rate)

**User Story**: *"As a team player, I want to know which heroes synergize well with my main so I can suggest optimal team compositions."*

### Phase 3: Advanced Analysis
- Full 6-hero team composition templates
- Counter-pick recommendations
- Meta trend tracking over time
- Role distribution optimization (2-2-2 vs other comps)

**User Story**: *"As a content creator, I want to track how the meta evolves patch-to-patch so I can create timely content."*

## Product Principles

### 1. Data Quality First
- Never present data without sufficient sample size
- Always show confidence intervals
- Filter for current season/patch only
- Deduplicate matches to avoid bias

### 2. Accessibility
- Clear, non-technical explanations
- Visual representations where helpful
- Export formats for third-party tools
- API for community integrations

### 3. Transparency
- Document sampling methodology
- Explain statistical calculations
- Open source code and schema
- Reproducible analysis

### 4. Respect for Players
- No player shaming or ranking
- Privacy-conscious data collection
- Rate limit compliance with API
- Community feedback integration

### 5. Scientific Rigor
- Stratified random sampling
- Bias mitigation strategies
- Peer-reviewable methodology
- Conservative confidence thresholds

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Sample Size**: 50,000+ matches collected
- **Coverage**: All 40+ heroes analyzed
- **Accuracy**: Win rates ±5% of community consensus
- **Freshness**: Data updated weekly

### Community Metrics
- **Adoption**: Used by 10+ content creators
- **Citations**: Referenced in tier lists/guides
- **Feedback**: Positive community reception
- **Impact**: Influences team composition discussions

### Quality Metrics
- **Statistical Significance**: 95% confidence on all reported stats
- **Representativeness**: Sample distribution matches ranked population
- **Reliability**: Consistent results across re-sampling
- **Validity**: Correlates with tournament/high-level play

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- ❌ Player ranking or leaderboards (use official tools)
- ❌ Live match tracking (use Overwolf/trackers)
- ❌ Build recommendations (gear/loadouts)
- ❌ Real-time meta dashboard (focus on analysis)
- ❌ Social features (comments, profiles)
- ❌ Monetization (free community tool)

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Discover Players → Collect Matches → Store in DB → Analyze → Export Results
```

### Storage
- **SQLite**: Local caching, deduplication, fast queries
- **JSON**: Shareable analysis results
- **Python scripts**: Modular, reproducible analysis

### Analysis Pipeline
1. **Collection**: Stratified sampling across ranks
2. **Cleaning**: Deduplicate, filter current season
3. **Aggregation**: Group by hero/rank/team
4. **Statistics**: Calculate rates, intervals, significance
5. **Export**: JSON with metadata and methodology

## Development Approach

### Spec-Driven Development
- Each feature has a detailed specification
- Specs define: Problem, Solution, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks
- Implementation follows approved specs
- Changes require spec updates

### Iterative Releases
- **MVP (Week 1)**: Single character, 50 players, prove concept
- **Phase 1 (Week 2-3)**: All characters, 500 players, full coverage
- **Phase 2 (Week 4-5)**: Team synergies, pair analysis
- **Phase 3 (Month 2)**: Advanced features, web export

### Quality Gates
- ✅ Code review before merge
- ✅ Sample data testing
- ✅ Statistical validation
- ✅ Documentation updates
